### What's our final major project? 

__Blaise__ is an infrared wave domestic oven.

It uses infrared light to warm, heat up
and cook aliments in short periods of time
(at least faster than microwave conventional ovens).
It also needs much less energy since creating
infrared waves is less energetic than microwaves
